      <h2><strong>What is a Golden Retriever?</strong></h2>
        <p>The Golden Retriever is a Scottish breed of retriever dog of medium size. It is characterised by a gentle and affectionate nature and a striking golden coat. It is commonly kept as a pet and is among the most frequently registered breeds in several Western countries. It is a frequent competitor in dog shows and obedience trials; it is also used as a gundog, and may be trained for use as a guide dog.</p>
        <p>The breed was created by Sir Dudley Marjoribanks at his Scottish estate Guisachan in the late nineteenth century. He cross-bred Flat-coated Retrievers with Tweed Water Spaniels, with some further infusions of Red Setter, Labrador Retriever and Bloodhound. The breed was recognised by the Kennel Club in 1913, and during the interwar period spread to many parts of the world.</p>

      <h2>Why the Golden?</h2>
        <p>The Golden Retriever is considered an intelligent, gentle natured and very affectionate breed of dog. As is typical with retriever breeds, the breed is generally calm and biddable, being very easy to train and extremely keen to please their master.[5][7] The breed is known to make excellent pets and family dogs, being generally extremely tolerant of children and keen to accompany any member of the family in a range of activities. Due to their affable natures, the breed is often completely devoid of guarding instincts.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>What should they eat?</h2>
        <p>Golden Retrievers can consume a wide variety of healthy and nutritious foods.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Beef</li>
          <li>Chicken</li>
          <li>Oats</li>
          <li>Buckwheat</li>
          <li>Eggs</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>The best diet for Golden Retrievers is a high-quality protein-rich diet consisting of 18-22% protein. Dogs can also get nutrients from vegetables, fruits, and grains. However, they should have the right amount of protein, fats, vitamins, minerals, and fiber for optimum health and lifespan.</strong></p>
